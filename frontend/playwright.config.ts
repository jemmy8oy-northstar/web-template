/**
 * Playwright e2e config for the frontend.
 *
 * These tests drive the app off mocked API responses (see e2e/mocks.ts), so
 * they need no backend and render deterministically. Each spec also captures
 * full-page screenshots into e2e/screenshots/ for visual review.
 *
 * Run:  npm run test:e2e            (headless, starts the dev server for you)
 *       npm run test:e2e -- --ui    (interactive)
 *
 * e2e/screenshots/ is GITIGNORED and asserts nothing — page.screenshot() is a
 * plain write, not a comparison, so these files can never fail a build.
 *
 * ⚠️ This comment used to claim the CI job uploads e2e/screenshots/ as a
 * per-PR artifact. It does not — ci.yml uploads playwright-report/ and only
 * `if: failure()`. e2e/README.md has the step to add if you want them.
