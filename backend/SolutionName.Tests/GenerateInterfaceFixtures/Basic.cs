/// Fixtures for InterfaceFromConcreteGenerator (#88).

/// <remarks>
/// Every class in this folder declares <c>: I{Name}</c> — an interface that
/// exists nowhere in source. If the generator emits a mirror that does not
/// match the class, THIS PROJECT DOES NOT COMPILE. That makes compilation the
/// primary assertion; GenerateInterfaceTests.cs covers what a successful
/// compile cannot see (what was deliberately left out, and where inherited
/// members ended up).
///
/// This type exercises the ordinary surface: properties, accessors, methods,
/// and the members that must NOT be mirrored.
